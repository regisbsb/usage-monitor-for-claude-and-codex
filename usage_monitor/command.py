Command
========

Execute user-configured shell commands on usage events.

Commands run as fire-and-forget subprocesses.  Event details are passed
via environment variables so the user's script can inspect them without
any string interpolation in the command itself.

# launches an app runs for as long as the user keeps that app open; when it
# eventually exits non-zero - it crashed, was killed, or was replaced by a
# second instance of itself - that is not a broken configuration, and a dialog
# raised minutes or hours after the click has no visible connection to it.

    """Launch shell commands with event-specific environment variables.

    Each command runs asynchronously (fire-and-forget).  Exceptions from
    ``subprocess.Popen`` are caught per command so one failure does not
    prevent the remaining commands from running.

    Parameters
    ----------
    commands : list[str]
        Shell command strings to execute.
    env_vars : dict[str, str]
        Mapping of ``USAGE_MONITOR_*`` environment variable names to
        their values.  Merged into the current process environment.
    capture_output : bool
        When True, capture each command's stdout, stderr, and exit code and
        print them once it finishes, and raise an error message box with
        stderr if the command exits with a non-zero code.  Used for
        user-driven actions (the "Test event commands" menu and the
        double-click command) so a failing command is not swallowed silently.
        The wait happens on a background thread, so the call stays
        non-blocking even for a command that keeps running (e.g. a launched
        app).
    report_late_failures : bool
        Only meaningful with *capture_output*.  When False, the error message
        box is limited to commands that fail within ``_STARTUP_FAILURE_WINDOW``
        seconds of launching; a later non-zero exit is printed but not shown.
        Used for the double-click command, which typically launches an app the
        user keeps open.  The "Test event commands" menu leaves it True - there
        the exit code is the point of running the command.
