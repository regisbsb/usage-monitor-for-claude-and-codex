"""
Notification Identity
=====================

Registers a fixed toast-notification identity (name and logo) for the process.

Windows shows the process's app icon in the header of a tray notification.
Without an explicit identity that icon is the live tray icon, which reflects
the most-exhausted quota - so a "quota reset" or "50% used" toast would carry
the exhausted glyph and contradict its own text.  Registering an
``AppUserModelID`` with a neutral logo makes every toast show that logo
instead, independent of the tray icon.

    Writes the ``DisplayName`` and ``IconUri`` registration to ``HKCU`` and,

    build extracts the logo to a fresh temporary directory each run, changing
    its path.
